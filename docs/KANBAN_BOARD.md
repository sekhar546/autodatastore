# Project Kanban Board

This Kanban board tracks the progress of tasks for the Vehicle Specifications Data Storage System.

## To Do

*   [ ] Performance Optimization (Initial) - Sub-tasks: Query plan analysis, Batch processing optimization
*   [ ] Utilize Kanban Board (Trello) - Note: This task will be marked as completed once this Markdown Kanban board is fully adopted.

## In Progress

(No tasks currently in progress)

## Done

*   Analyze requirements
*   Design architecture
*   Implement core logic
*   Add JSONB query examples to notebook
*   Create GIN index for JSONB field
*   Document schema extension process
*   Refine `additionalFeatures` Handling
*   Brainstorm and categorize vehicle attributes.
*   Present the proposed data model for vehicle specifications.
*   Ask for user feedback on the proposed data model.
*   Revise data model based on user feedback (remove bicycles, use metric units, remove VIN, add IDs, trim granularity).
*   Present the revised data model for vehicle specifications.
*   Revise data model to include a flexible field for future features.
*   Present the final data model for vehicle specifications.
*   Revise data model based on latest user feedback (move number of doors, add detailed climate control, seat adjustments, lighting, tire dimensions, and suggest missing features).
*   Revise data model based on new user feedback (split front seat adjustment, add rear seat type/headrest, 360 camera, sunroof, ground clearance, parking assist).
*   Present the final, refined data model.
*   Discuss data formats and technologies (dbt with PostgreSQL).
*   Discuss programming needs (Python with UV and Jupyter notebooks).
*   Discuss Apache Airflow for orchestration and suggest a free Kanban board tool.
*   Prepare necessary design documentation (data model, schema).
*   Prepare solution documentation (overall architecture, component interaction).
*   Create detailed implementation task list (agile documentation).
*   Propose and document the project folder structure.
*   Suggest switching to Code mode for implementation.
*   Implement the project folder structure.
*   Move documentation files to the `docs/` folder.
*   Explain how to integrate tasks into Trello manually.
*   Set up PostgreSQL Database (Verify Docker image, Create DB/User, Configure connection).
*   Initialize dbt Project (Install dbt, Create project, Configure profiles.yml, dbt debug).
*   Set up Python Environment with UV (Install UV, Create venv, Install libraries, Verify).
*   Basic Airflow Setup (Install Astro CLI - requires user to run with sudo).
*   Basic Airflow Setup (Initialize Astro project).
*   Basic Airflow Setup (Start Airflow using Astro CLI).
*   Create Staging Tables in PostgreSQL.
*   Implement dbt Models for Core Tables.
*   Add dbt Tests for Data Quality.
*   Run dbt models to create tables/views.
*   Generate dbt Documentation.
*   Develop Initial Data Ingestion Script (Python).
*   Integrate Python Ingestion with Airflow (if Airflow is used).
*   Integrate dbt Runs with Airflow (if Airflow is used).
*   Develop Sample Data Query/Analysis (Jupyter Notebook).
*   Refine `additionalFeatures` Handling.
*   Create GIN index for JSONB field
*   Maintain Design Documentation.
*   Maintain Solution Documentation.
